# ## Bootstrap (this cell is identical in every notebook)
#
# Three ways to get the code onto the Kaggle machine, tried in order:
#
# 1. **GitHub clone** — set `REPO_URL` below and turn *Internet* ON in the notebook
#    settings panel (Settings → Internet → On). This is the recommended route.
# 2. **Repo-as-dataset** — upload this folder as a Kaggle Dataset called
#    `speaker-count-separate-v1` and attach it. No internet needed. Use this if your
#    account cannot enable internet (phone-verification is required for that).
# 3. **Already there** — an existing clone is **fast-forwarded to the newest commit**,
#    not reused as-is. A Kaggle session outlives many pushes, and silently running code
#    from an hour ago is the most expensive kind of confusion: the log looks fine and the
#    fix you are testing is not in it. Any local edits inside the clone are discarded.
#
# Whichever route runs, the commit is printed. Every log can then be traced to the exact
# code that produced it.
